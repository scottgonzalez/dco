* `name` (String): The person's name.
* `email` (String): The person's email.

### commit objects

Commit objects represent a single commit within a repository. They are plain objects with the following properties:

* `hash` (String): The SHA-1 for the commit.
* `author` (Object): A [person object](#person-objects) containing the author's information.
* `committer` (Object): A [person object](#person-objects) containing the committer's information.
* `license` (Array): An array of [person objects](#person-objects) containing all signers of the commit.

### dco.getCommits( options, callback )

Gets commit and signature information for a repository.

* `options` (Object): Options for getting the commits.
  * `path` (String): The path to the repository.
  * `committish` (String): Committish range to analyze.
  * `exceptionalAuthors` (Object): A hash of email addresses and names for authors who may commit without signing their commits.
* `callback` (Function; `function( error, commits )`): Function to invoke after getting the commits.
  * `commits` (Array): An array of [commit objects](#commit-objects) for the repository.

* `options` (Object): Options for getting the commits.
  * `path` (String): The path to the repository.
  * `committish` (String): Committish range to analyze.
  * `exceptionalAuthors` (Object): A hash of email addresses and names for authors who may commit without signing their commits.
* `callback` (Function; `function( error, errors, commits )`): Function to invoke after determining the commit errors.
